# Simulating-an-Epidemic

While the spread of viral epidemics like covid-19 in a sample population depend on agent factors like infectivity and contact radius, it also depends on a variety of population parameters like the population density, mobility, Number of people following personal hygiene, effective testing and tracing and so on. Hence I attempted a simple SIR simulation model on a sample population, while tuning parameters like contact radius, percentage of people following personal hygiene, mobility rate, testing and isolation effeciency etc. Considering the pre-lockdown during lockdown and post-lockdown scenarios, one can have a comparative study of the daily change in number of infected and the anticipation of the peak of the curve given different initial conditions and social parameters. One could also visualise the change in the number of causalities even by taking a small right step. The difference in curve peaks that we see is caused just by imposing personal hygiene on 20% of the entire population.

I am currently working on this project and I intend to write a report/blog on my observations soon.
